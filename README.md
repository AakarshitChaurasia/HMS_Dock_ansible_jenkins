1. This project focuses on improving the internal management system of hospitals by working online
2. Creating an interface to help patients to book an appointment at their convenience and also they can book ambulance from here by sharing their actual location which can help drivers to reach easily to them. Each user (Admin, Patient, Doctors) can securely log in to their own account, using that Patients can take services from the hospital and Doctors can easily manage their patients and Admin supervise all the actions like adding medicine records and treatment type, etc. Patients’ prescription, treatment, and appointment records are also available online to limit paper usage. 
3. Yes, the project’s purpose and basic functionality mapped to the problem statement/opportunity area, but some functions are limited since it is a demo project.
